Real FizzBuzz
=============

Part 0
------
Write some code that for a contiguous range of numbers prints out the following:
* 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
* 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5
* 'fizzbuzz' for numbers that are multiples of 15

e.g. Running the programme over a range from 1-20 should give the following output

```
"" "" fizz "" buzz fizz "" "" fizz buzz "" fizz "" "" fizzbuzz "" "" fizz "" buzz
```

Part 1
------
Write some code that for a contiguous range of numbers prints out the following:
* the number
* 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
* 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5
* 'fizzbuzz' for numbers that are multiples of 15


e.g. Running the programme over a range from 1-20 should give the following output

```
1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
```

Part 2
------
Enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following:

* If the number contains a three you must output the text 'lucky'. This overrides any existing behaviour

e.g. Running the programme over a range from 1-20 should give the following output

```
1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
```
